Hello! 

I am a Tobin Predoctoral Fellow at Yale SOM, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Stefano Giglio](https://sites.google.com/view/stefanogiglio/?authuser=3) and Professor [Johannes Stroebel](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~jstroebe/). Prior to this role, I graduated from Columbia University with a joint degree in Economics-Statistics and conducted research under Professor [Daniel Bj√∂rkegren](https://dan.bjorkegren.com/). I have also previously done research under Professor [Aneesh Raghunandan](https://www.aneeshraghunandan.com/) and Professor [Shivaram Rajgopal](https://www.shivarajgopal.com/).
