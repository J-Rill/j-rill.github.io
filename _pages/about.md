Hello! 

I am a Tobin Predoctoral Fellow at Yale SOM, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Stefano Giglio](https://sites.google.com/view/stefanogiglio/?authuser=3) and Professor [Johannes Stroebel](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~jstroebe/). I graduated from Columbia University with a joint degree in Economics-Statistics in May 2024. 

**Some other fun facts about me**

I studied in Ontario, Jakarta, Tokyo, and Manila before moving to the US for university.

Throughout my time at Columbia, I conducted research under Professor [Daniel Bj√∂rkegren](https://dan.bjorkegren.com/) on 2 projects: evaluating the effectiveness of Generative AI in improving educational outcomes for underresourced communities and working with the transport authority of a developing country to build public transport infrastructure. I have also previously conducted research under Professor [Aneesh Raghunandan](https://www.aneeshraghunandan.com/) and Professor [Shivaram Rajgopal](https://www.shivarajgopal.com/) on whether firms uphold job creation targets that are offered in exchange for state aid.

Previously, I have worked at Citi as a Markets Summer Analyst and developed machine learning and autoregressive models to help traders make more statistically informed decisions. I've also dabbled in public policy consulting at Vriens & Partners for Fortune 500 clients in the Philippines. On campus, I was involved with Columbia UNICEF (Treasurer & Fundraising Committee Head), Liga Filipina (International Student Rep), and Alpha Kappa Psi. 

**Hobbies!**
Basketball, volleyball, Super Smash Bros Ultimate, FIFA, reading, [euphonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphonium), piano
