Hello! 

I am a senior studying Statistics and Economics at Columbia University, where I am currently assisting Professor [Daniel Bj√∂rkegren](dan.bjorkegren.com) with his research on integrating artificial intelligence in the classrooms of developing countries. 

I have previously assisted Professor [Aneesh Raghunandan](https://www.aneeshraghunandan.com/) and Professor [Shivaram Rajgopal](https://www.shivarajgopal.com/) with [their research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11142-023-09804-6#Sec15) on the extent to which firms meet job creation targets. After graduation, I will be joining Yale Tobin as a Predoctoral Fellow under Professor [Stefano Giglio](https://sites.google.com/view/stefanogiglio/?authuser=3) and Professor [Johannes Stroebel](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~jstroebe/). My research interests lie within the fields of Climate Finance and Development Economics.
