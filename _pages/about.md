Hello! 

I am a Predoctoral Research Fellow at Yale School of Management, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Stefano Giglio](https://sites.google.com/view/stefanogiglio/?authuser=3) and [Johannes Stroebel](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~jstroebe/). My research interests include expectation formation, climate finance, and ESG. I graduated _cum laude_ from Columbia University with a joint degree in Economics-Statistics in May 2024. 
Throughout my time at Columbia, I conducted research under Professor [Daniel Björkegren](https://dan.bjorkegren.com/) on 2 projects: evaluating the effectiveness of Generative AI in improving educational outcomes for underresourced communities and working with the transport authority of a developing country to build public transport infrastructure. I have also previously worked as an RA under [Aneesh Raghunandan](https://www.aneeshraghunandan.com/) and [Shivaram Rajgopal](https://www.shivarajgopal.com/) on whether firms uphold job creation targets that are offered in exchange for state aid.
