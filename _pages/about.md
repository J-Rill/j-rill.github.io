Hello! I am a senior studying [Statistics](stat.columbia.edu) and [Economics](econ.columbia.edu) at [Columbia University](columbia.edu), where I am currently assisting Professor [Daniel Bj√∂rkegren](dan.bjorkegren.com) with his research on integrating artificial intelligence in the classrooms of developing countries. After graduation, I will be joining [Yale Tobin](tobin.yale.edu) as a Predoctoral Fellow under Professor [Stefano Giglio](https://sites.google.com/view/stefanogiglio/?authuser=3) and Professor [Johannes Stroebel](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~jstroebe/). My research interests lie within the fields of Climate Finance and Development Economics.
